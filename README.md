# elm-pomodoro

A simple [tomato-timer.com](http://tomato-timer.com/) clone implemented with Elm as a learning exercise.

This also has a few niceties that make developing larger Elm apps easier, such
as SCSS, Jade, and BrowserSync.

## Getting started

```shell
elm install
npm install
npm start
```
